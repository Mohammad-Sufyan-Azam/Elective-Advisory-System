Hey, my name is Sufyan and I am a 3rd year undergrad at IIITD. My goal is to become an AI Engineer. 
I have done courses like DBMS, PB, AI, TAIS, and MTL. I loved all of these courses and they provided me with a lot of 
valuable information on how things work at the grass root level. Also, my CGPA is above 8. 
Can you suggest me some electives that can help me in achieving my goal?!
