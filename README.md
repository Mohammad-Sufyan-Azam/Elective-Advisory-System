# Elective-Advisory-System

## Part 1
The task is to create an electives advisory system in Prolog for BTech students of IIITD. The system advises students on elective choices based on their career aspirations and completed prerequisites. It utilizes Prolog features such as Lists, Input/Output, Recursion, Backtracking, and Binding. The program handles different inputs for different students and provides practical and useful advice/predictions.

## Part 2
In this task, the objective is to create a career advisory system using the durable-rules module in Python. The system utilizes forward-chaining rules based on the courses completed, grades obtained, and interest areas of a graduating student from IIITD. The goal is to build a proactive AI system that takes input data and suggests potential career options for the user based on the forward-chaining rules.

## Part 3
The task is to create a machine learning-based career advisory system using a samplle dataset ('roo-data.csv') containing graduates information. Steps include dataset preparation, training an ANN model, predicting job roles, evaluating accuracy, and experimenting with data preparation techniques. Also connected the system with an electives advisory system, clubbed similar job roles, and bucketized attribute values.

## Part 4
The task involves building a Python-based natural language interface for the electives advisory system built in part 1 in Prolog. Steps include reading and processing input text, defining a knowledge base, extracting career interests and courses done through NLP, writing facts into a text file, reading the file from Prolog and asserting them, processing information to find suitable electives, and printing results. The goal is to create an effective and interesting interface that integrates NLP and Prolog to provide accurate and relevant elective recommendations based on user input.
